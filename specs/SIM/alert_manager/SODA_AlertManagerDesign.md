# SODA Alert Manager Design Document
**Authors:** [Sushantha Kumar](https://github.com/sushanthakumar), [Shufang Zeng](https://github.com/sfzeng)

This documentation serves as the design spec for Alert manager module of SODA Infrastructure Management
## Goal
This document will propose the key aspects of alert manager, its key requirements, interfaces, data model and low level design details involving sequence diagrams for major flows

## Non-Goals
This design does not cover the deployment model or the way in which this module will be installed with other modules of infra management framework 

## Assumptions and Constraints
* SNMP also supports informs which are similar to traps but need acknowledgement from the manager to ensure guaranteed delivery. This design does not consider the support for SNMP informs.
* SNMP v2c/v3 configuration need to be done at device side also which will be taken care by Administrator

|                     | Update trap receiver with alert source config |
| Output    | Input alert source is saved to database and trap receiver is updated accordingly to handle traps |
| Priority     | High |
| Remarks     | None|

##### AlertMngr.Int.005 List alert source configuration
|  |  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Brief Description    | Listing all configured alert sources |
| Precondition       | Module is up |
| Input     | List alert source request from admin  |
| Key Processings     | Validate input query request |
|                     | Return the list of all alert sources from DB |
| Output    | List of all alert sources|
| Priority     | High |
| Remarks     | None|

##### AlertMngr.Int.006 Delete alert source configuration
|  |  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Brief Description    | Deleting already configured alert source |
| Precondition       | Module is up |
| Input     | Delete Alert source configuration request from admin  |
| Key Processings     | Validate input alert source delete request |
|                     | Delete alert source details from DB |
|                     | Remove alert source config details from trap receiver side |
| Output    | Input alert source configuration is deleted from database |
| Priority     | High |
| Remarks     | None|

##### AlertMngr.Int.007 Update alert source configuration
|  |  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Brief Description    | Updating existing alert source configuration |
